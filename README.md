# Camouflage: Where pictures are worth a thousand words...

# About the project

We believe that data security and data storage are integral issues in today's world. We present a hack that combines an extremely safe data security algorithm building upon and inspired by block chains and steganography with an extremely affordable cloud storage solution.
When we studied data over the public domain, we realized that cloud platforms handle a large amount of media- images, audio and video (1 billion images at an average are uploaded to Google Photos and Google drive alone every single day), and there is a pressing need of affordable data storage solutions. Besides, data security is integral in today's world with increasing instances of data theft. We suggest a cloud platform that serves both the needs. 

# WORKING
A user for free can upload media to our cloud service and his data storage needs are taken care off by a healthy and state-of-the art cloud. For entities such as banks, governments, lawyers and others who wish to securely store their data such as banking transactions, sensitive citizen data and property data, can use our web application to securely store there data as well. 

At the local instance of the user we encrypt there data and transfer it to our centralized server over secured links. The central server hashes the encrypted data to ascertain and assure the users data integrity.It then divides the data into a number of packets and encodes these packets into the media that is already stored in the cloud in abundance. Every packet is stored in more than one images to ensure accessibility and availability of data. Our least significant bit encoding methodology added to our intelligent blob detection and image processing algorithms encodes data into the images with negligible change in visual perception and appearance of the image. 

# HOW SAFE IS THE DATA?
For a hacker to steal data from our system he or she will have to go through the following steps which will at least take years at end: 
1. Amidst all the media stored, search for the images that have embedded/encoded data into them. Finding some millions of media in a cloud of many billions...
2. Then for each image apply steganalysis to search for the encoded/embedded information which is devoid of any pattern since the packets of data of many users are stored together in a single image. 
3. Then if he manages to come this far, decrypt the packets of information encrypted by some of the strongest encryption algorithms available...
4. If he can do that as well, then he'd just have to find the remaining packets of the same data to make any sense of the complete information..

Basically, it is virtually impossible to hackers to hack into our security motivated by block chains and media encoding. 

# USED CASE 
Banks as well as governments need our solution to store their data that is extremely confidential. At the same time, data storage of media files, growing at an exponential rate is an integral necessity for each one of us.      

# FUTURE PROSPECTS
We are planning on inclusion of IPFS and other distributed and safer protocols, as well as securing our distributed cloud server more.
